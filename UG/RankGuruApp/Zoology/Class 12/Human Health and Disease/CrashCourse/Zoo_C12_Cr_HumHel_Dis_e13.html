    <ul>
      <p><li>Cannabis sativa is an annual herbaceous flowering plant indigenous to
        eastern Asia but now of cosmopolitan distribution due to widespread
        cultivation.
        <ul>
          <p><li> It has been cultivated throughout recorded history, used as a
            source of industrial fiber, seed oil, food, recreation, religious and spiritual
          moods, and medicine.</li></p>
          <p><li>The leaves are palmately compound or digitate, with
          serrate leaflets.</li></p>

          <p><li> The first pair of leaves usually have a single leaflet, the
            number gradually increasing up to a maximum of about thirteen leaflets per
          leaf (usually seven or nine), depending on variety and growing conditions.</li></p>

          <p><li>At
            the top of a flowering plant, this number again diminishes to a single leaflet
          per leaf.</li></p>
          <p><li>The lower leaf pairs usually occur in an opposite leaf arrangement
            and the upper leaf pairs in an alternate arrangement on the main stem of a
          mature plant.</li></p>


        </ul>
      </li></p>
      <p><li>
        <ul>
          <p><li>Papaver somniferum, commonly known as the opium poppy, is a species of
          flowering plant in the family Papaveraceae.</li></p>
          <p><li>It is the species of plant from
            which opium and poppy seeds are derived and is a valuable ornamental
          plant, grown in gardens.</li></p>

          <p><li>Its native range is probably the eastern
            Mediterranean but is now obscured by ancient introductions and
          cultivation.</li></p>

          <p><li>The large leaves are lobed, the upper stem leaves clasping the
          stem, the lowest leaves with a short petiole.</li></p>

        </ul>
      </li></p>

      <p><b>    So the correct option is 'A and B'.
      </b></p>


    </ul>
