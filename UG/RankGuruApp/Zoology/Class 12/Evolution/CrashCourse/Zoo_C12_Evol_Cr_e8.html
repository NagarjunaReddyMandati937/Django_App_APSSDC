   <ul>
    
    <p><li>The primitive earth conditions were highly reduced due to the absence of
    oxygen.</li></p>
    <p><li>Due to the polymerization of the simple organic compounds, the
    biomolecules like proteins.</li></p>
    <p><li> Carbohydrates, nucleic acids evolved first.</li></p>
    <p><li>So,
    genes were the first to have evolved.</li></p>
    <p><li> As there was no oxygen and no
    producer of organic carbon.</li></p>
    <p><li>So, chemoautotrophic bacteria that synthesized
      their organic carbon from the inorganic compounds like iron, sulfur or
    magnesium.</li></p>
    <p><li>They did not use the carbon dioxide and also did not release
    the oxygen. Methane, organic sulfur etc.</li></p>
    <p><li>were the by-products of
    chemosynthesis.</li></p>
    <p><li> Now, due to chemoautotrophs, anaerobic heterotrophs
      evolved as they did not need to have oxygen for their energy production and
      the food was already available from the chemoautotrophs, anaerobic
    heterotrophs were next to evolve.</li></p>
    <p><li>Gradually, photoautotrophs like
      cyanobacteria evolved that could the atmospheric carbon dioxide and
    released the oxygen as the by-product in the presence of the sunlight.</li></p>

    <p><b>Hence, the correct answer is 'C -D - B - A'.
