   <ul>
    <p><li>The conditions on the primitive earth were high reducing due to the absence
      of oxygen.
      <p><li> Some 2.7 billion years ago, oxygenic photoautotrophs evolved.</li></p>
      <p><li>They were oxygenic because they released oxygen as the by-product and
      photoautotroph because they used sunlight as the source of energy.</li></p>
      <p><li> Due to
        the release of oxygen, the reducing atmosphere changes into the oxidizing
      atmosphere.</li></p>

    </li></p>

    <p><li>A. Evolution of oxygenic photoautotrophs leads to the shift from reducing
      atmosphere to the oxidizing atmosphere because they used water as the
    electron donor in the photosynthesis and released oxygen as the by-product.</li></p>
    <p><li>B. Anoxygenic photoautotrophs used sunlight as an energy source but did
      not release the oxygen as the by-product because they did not use water as
    an electron donor. Sulfur was used for this purpose.</li></p>
    <p><li>C. Chemophotoautotrophs also did not use the water as an electron donor so
    they did not release the oxygen. They used hydrogen gas or hydrogen sulfide.</li></p>
    <p><li>D. Anaerobic heterotrophs did not release oxygen. They used the already
    available organic carbon for the energy requirements.</li></p>
    <p><b>Hence, the correct answer is 'Evolution of oxygenic photoautotrophs'.   
    </b></p>
