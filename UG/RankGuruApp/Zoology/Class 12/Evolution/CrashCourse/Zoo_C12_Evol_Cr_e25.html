    <p><b>    These points are as follows:
    </b></p>
    <p><li>A. All living organisms were created same day <b>[NO DIFFERENCE IN THEIR
    APPEARANCE]</b>.</li></p>
    <p><li> B. They were created in the present form <b>[NO EVOLUTION]</b>.</li></p>
    <p><li>C. Their bodies and organs are fully developed to meet the requirement to
      run the life <b>[NO ADAPTATION]</b>.</li></p>
