    <ul>

      <p><li>Assertion is correct as at Galapagos Islands, Darwin observed that the
        finches had different types of beaks suited for eating large seeds, flying
        insects and cactus seeds that means they are adapted for feeding on
      different diets.</li></p>
      <p><li>Reason is also correct and correct explanation of assertion because it was
        the ancestral seed-eating stock of Darwin's finches radiated out from South
        American mainland to different geographical areas of the Galapagos
        Islands, where they found different types of food and competitor free new
      habitats.</li></p>

      <p><b> Hence, option A is correct.
      </b></p>
