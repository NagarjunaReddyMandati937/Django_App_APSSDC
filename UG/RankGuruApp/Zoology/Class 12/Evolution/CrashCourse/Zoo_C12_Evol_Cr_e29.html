   <ul>
    <p><li>The insects live in the burrow in the tree bark and mutation in the beak size
      leading to increasing in its size conferred the survival advantage to the
    birds having this mutation.</li></p>
    <p><li>This is because large beak size enables them to
    trap the insects from inside of the burrow.</li></p>
    <p><li>Natural selection favoured this
      mutation owing to survival advantage and gradually the number of birds
      having this mutation increased i.e., the evolution of the birds having large
    beak size.</li></p>
    
    <p><b>Thus, the correct answer is option C.    
    </b></p>
