   <ul>

    <p><li>First living organisms on earth were chemoheterotrophs (II) that do not
      perform oxygenic photosynthesis and used available organic molecules as
    source of carbon and energy source.</li></p>
    <p><li> Due to limited supply of organic
      compounds, organisms evolved photosystem to capture sunlight to be used
    as source of energy thereby leading to origin of photoautotrophs (IV).</li></p>
    <p><li>Both of
      these were prokaryotes and gradually increasing complexity of body
    organization lead to evolution of eukaryotes (I).</li></p>
    <p><li>Metazoa (also known as
      Animalia) includes multicellular eukaryotic organisms which appeared after
    unicellular eukaryotes (III).</li></p>
    
    <p><b>Therefore, the correct answer is option C.
