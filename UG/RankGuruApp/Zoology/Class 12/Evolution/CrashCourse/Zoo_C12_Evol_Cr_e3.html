    <p><li> (a) Sweet potato is a root modification and potato tuber is a stem
      modification but they show convergent evolution because both of them are
      unrelated and perform the functions similar to the storage of food and
    vegetative reproduction.</li></p>
    <p><li>(b) The thorns of Bougainvillea and tendrils of Cucurbita are homologous
    organs- Divergent evolution.</li></p>
    <p><li>(c) Dolphins evolved from mammals that walked on land, whereas,
      penguins evolved from birds that flew in the air. Both organisms developed
      similar structures (i.e. flippers because they both can swim in the water).
    This is an example of convergent evolution.</li></p>
    <p><li>(d) Bat wings consist of flaps of skin stretched between the bones of the
      fingers and arm. Birds wings consist of feathers extending all along the arm.
    They don't have a common ancestor. So it is convergent evolution.</li></p>
    <p><li>(e) Eyes of octopus and mammals show analogy that is structurally
      different but functionally the same. So they are an example of convergent
    evolution.</li></p>
    <p><li>(f) The sting of honey bee and scorpion are homologous organs and so they
    show divergent evolution.</li></p>
    <p><b>So, the correct answer is '2'.
