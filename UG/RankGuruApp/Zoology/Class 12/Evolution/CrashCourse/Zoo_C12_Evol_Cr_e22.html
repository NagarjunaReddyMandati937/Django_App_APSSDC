    <ul>
      <p><li>The RNA world hypothesis proposes that self-replicating ribonucleic acid
        (RNA) molecules were precursors to all current life on Earth.
        <ul>
          <p><li> It is generally
            accepted that current life on Earth descends from an RNA world, although
          RNA-based life may not have been the first life to exist.</li></p>


        </ul>
      </li></p>
      <p><li>RNA stores genetic information like DNA, and catalyzes chemical reactions
        like an enzyme protein.
        <ul>
          <p><li> It may, therefore, have played a major step in the
          evolution of cellular life.</li></p>
          <p><li>The RNA world would have eventually been replaced
            by the DNA, RNA and protein world of today, likely through an intermediate
            stage of ribonucleoprotein enzymes such as the ribosome and ribozymes,
            since proteins large enough to self-fold and have useful activities would
            only have come about after RNA was available to catalyze peptide ligation or
          amino acid polymerization.</li></p>
          <p><li>DNA is thought to have taken over the role of
            data storage due to its increased stability, while proteins, through a greater
            variety of monomers (amino acids), replaced RNA's role in specialized
          biocatalysis.</li></p>
        </ul>
      </li></p>
      <p><li>The RNA world hypothesis is supported by many independent lines of
        evidence, such as the observations that RNA is central to the translation
        process and that small RNAs can catalyze all of the chemical group and
        information transfers required for life. 
        <ul>
          <p><li>The structure of the ribosome has
            been called as the "smoking gun," as it showed that the ribosome is a
            ribozyme, with a central core of RNA and no amino acid side chains within 18
          angstroms of the active site where peptide bond formation is catalyzed.</li></p>
        </ul>
      </li></p>
      <p><li>So, Most biologists think that RNA was the first genetic material because,
        the existence of ribozymes suggests that early cells could have used RNA to
        catalyze chemical reactions and transfer information. 
        <ul>
          <p><li>So, Biologists believe
            that the current DNA RNA protein system is the result of a long period of
            evolution because evidence indicates that RNA preceded DNA as the genetic
          material.</li></p>

        </ul>
      </li></p>
      
      <p><b>Thus, option C is correct and other options are wrong.
