      more traits.
      <ul>
        <p><li>It is a key mechanism of evolution, the change in heritable
        traits of a population over time.</li></p>
      </ul>
    </li></p>
    <p><li>Reason is also correct and correct explanation of assertion as adaptive
      forms of a given trait tend to become more common, less adaptive ones
      become less common or disappear.
      <ul>
        <p><li>The unequal ability of individuals to
          survive and reproduce will lead to a gradual change in population with
          favorable characteristics accumulating over the generation, which leads to
        the formation of new species.</li></p>
      </ul>
    </li></p>
