    <p><li>Non-invasive refers to the medical procedures, where there is no use of
      instruments in the body.
      <ul>
        <p><li>Now, Chorionic villi sampling is a test, made in
          early pregnancy to detect congenital abnormalities in the fetus, in which a
        villi tissue is removed from the villi of the chorion.</li></p>

      </ul>
    </li></p>
    <p><li>Amniocentesis is a process, where amniotic fluid is sampled using a hollow
      needle inserted into the uterus.
      <ul>
        <p><li>This is done to test the health of the fetus,
        by checking for any type of chromosomal or genetic abnormalities.</li></p>
        <p><li>On the other hand, Foetoscopy is an endoscopic procedure pregnancy to
          allow surgical access to the fetus, the amniotic cavity, the umbilical cord,
        and the fetal side of the placenta.</li></p>

    <p><b>Therefore, none of these are non-invasive techniques.
