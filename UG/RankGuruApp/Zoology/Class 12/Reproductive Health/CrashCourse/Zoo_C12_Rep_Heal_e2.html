    <p><li>Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) is a group of special techniques
      which helps infertile couple by retrieving oocytes from the ovary or the
      sperms from the epididymis, then perform artificial insemination and
    development of the embryo.</li></p>
    <p><li>The 4 main types of techniques used under ART
      are GIFT or Gamete intrafallopian transfer, ZIFT or Zygote intra-fallopian
      transfer, IVF-ET or In vitro fertilization and embryo transfer & AIT or Artificial
    insemination technique.</li></p>
    <p><li>In the artificial insemination, the semen is
      extracted, washed, centrifuged and the motile sperms are taken & injected
    artificially into the uterus or the vagina.</li></p>
    <p><li>AIT too is of two types, AIH is done
    by husband's semen & AID this is performed by donor's semen.</li></p>
    
    <p><b>So the
    correct answer is 'A' 'Artificial insemination'.</b></p>
