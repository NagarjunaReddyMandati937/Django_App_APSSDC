    <p><li>Vas deferens is the dilated continuation of the epididymis.
      <ul>
        <p><li> It is located on
        the spermatic cord;</li></p>
        <p><li> hence, a male permanent (surgical) contraceptive
        method (vasectomy) is usually performed on it.</li></p>

      </ul>
    </li></p>
    <p><li>As it passes from the tail of the epididymis, it is covered by the spermatic
      cord containing testicular artery, vein, autonomic nerves, lymphatic and
    connective tissue.</li></p>
    <p><li>After the ducts pass through the inguinal canal it frees from the spermatic
      cord and passes behind the urinary bladder, where it travels alongside an
      accessory gland, the seminal vesicle and becomes ejaculatory duct.
      <ul>
        <p><li> Just
          before reaching the seminal vesicle, it widens into an enlarged portion,
        ampulla.</li></p>
      </ul>
    </li></p>
    <p><li>The ampulla is sperm storage sites before ejaculation.
      <ul>
        <p><li> It transports sperm
        by peristalsis during peak stimulation.</li></p>
        <p><li> If vas deferens is cut the semen will
        be without sperms.</li></p>

      </ul>
    </li></p>
