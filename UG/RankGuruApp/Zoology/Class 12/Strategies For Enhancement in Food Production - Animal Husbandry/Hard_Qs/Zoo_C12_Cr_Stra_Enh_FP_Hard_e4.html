   <ul>
    <p><li>Plants obtain minerals from the soil.
      <ul>
        <p><li>Hence, they can be grown in a soil less
        nutrient medium.</li></p>
        <p><li>Various nutrient media are also used to culture plant
        through micropropagation.</li></p>
        <p><li>Because plant cells are totipotent, hence they
        can be propagated through micropropagation.</li></p>

      </ul>
    </li></p>

    <p><li>Micropropagation is a technique used in plant tissue culture in which a
      small plant tissue (called as explant) of a plant can be used to obtain
    multiple new plants, i.e., propagate the mother plant.</li></p>
    <p><li>Murashige and Skoog medium or (MS Medium) is a plant growth
      medium used in the laboratories for the cultivation of the plant in cell
    culture.</li></p>

    <p><b>So, the correct answer is 'Raising plants through micropropagation'.
    </b></p>
