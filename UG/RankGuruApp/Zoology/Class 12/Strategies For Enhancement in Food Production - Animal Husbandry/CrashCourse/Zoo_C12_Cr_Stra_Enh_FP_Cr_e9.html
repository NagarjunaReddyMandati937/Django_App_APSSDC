   <ul>
    <p><li>A line consists of a group of individual related by descent and often similar
in genotype.</li></p>
    <p><li> The individual lines used in hybridization is known as parents.</li></p>
    <p><li>Hybridization is the process of mating two lines differing in their genotype.</li></p>
    <p><li>An offspring hence produced is called as hybrid. </li></p>
    <p><li>Emasculation is the
process in which the stamen of the flower is removed before the dehiscence
of anthers.</li></p>
    <p><li>This is done to prevent self hybridization.</li></p>
    <p><b>Thus, the correct answer is 'Parents'.
