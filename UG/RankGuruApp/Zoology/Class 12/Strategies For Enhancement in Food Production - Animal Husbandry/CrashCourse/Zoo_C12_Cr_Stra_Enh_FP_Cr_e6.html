    <p><li>Tuna is a salt water fish found in the ocean.
      <ul>
        <p><li> Tunas (fish belonging to the family
         Scombridae and genus Thunnus) are exclusively salt water fish living in the
       open ocean.</li></p>
       <p><li>Tuna swims constantly and are capable of bursts of
         extraordinary speed and are the most highly specialized fishes in regard to
       sustained, high levels of activity.</li></p>
       <p><li> They swim continuously to counterbalance
       their negative buoyancy, and are able to travel hundreds of miles.</li></p>
       
     </ul>
   </li></p>
   <p><li>Cat Fish (order Siluriformes) a diverse group of fish.
    <ul>
      <p><li> They are named for their
       prominent barbels, slender, whisker-like tactile organs near the mouth, which
     give the image of cat-like whiskers.</li></p>
     <p><li>Eating catfish also boosts your body's
     intake of heart-healthy amino acids.</li></p>
     <p><li>In addition, it is noted that a single
       serving of catfish provides a whopping 40-percent of an adult's daily intake
     of vitamin B-12, which helps the body convert food into energy.</li></p>        
   </ul>
 </li></p>
 <p><li>Mackerel, a salt water fish, is a common name applied to a number of different
   species of pelagic fish, mostly, but not exclusively, from the family Scombridae.
   <ul>
    <p><li>They are found in both temperate and tropical seas, mostly living along the
    coast or offshore in the oceanic environment.</li></p>


  </ul>
</li></p>
<p><li>Sharks, like other fish, possess gills in order to breathe underwater.
  <ul>
    <p><li>They
     generally have about five to seven-gill slits that are located on either side of
   their bodies.</li></p>
   <p><li>These gills filter the ocean water in order to obtain the oxygen
   that is necessary for these creatures to survive.</li></p>
   <p><li>Think of these gills as the
   “lungs” of the shark. Sharks are salt water fishes.</li></p>


 </ul>
</li></p>
<p><b>   So the correct option is 'catfish'.
