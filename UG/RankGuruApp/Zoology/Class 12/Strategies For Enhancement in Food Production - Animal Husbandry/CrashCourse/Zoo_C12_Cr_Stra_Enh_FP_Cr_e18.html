   <ul>
    <p><li>A. Mutation is the sudden and heritable change in the genetic material.</li></p>
    <p><li>B. Artificial selection is the deliberate selection of some species of plants
      and animals over other for their desirable characters. This is also known as
    selective breeding.</li></p>
    <p><li>C. Reverse evolution is a theory suggesting de-volution to the primitive form.
    </li></p>
    <p><li>D. Natural selection is the environmentally decided survival of the organism
    that occurs due to the favourable variations.</li></p>

    <p><b>So, the correct answer is 'Artificial selection'.
