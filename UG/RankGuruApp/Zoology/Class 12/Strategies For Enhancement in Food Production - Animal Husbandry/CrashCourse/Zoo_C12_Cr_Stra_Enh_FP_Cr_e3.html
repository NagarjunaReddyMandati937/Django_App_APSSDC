   <ul>
    <p><li>1. Breeding programs are done to produce varieties of desired characters
      and those are more productive because there is genetic variation in
      breeding when two organisms are crossed. Hence, genetic variability is the
    root of all breeding programs.</li></p>
    <p><li>2. Germplasm is basically the genetic material of cells. If desired alleles are
      absent in the germplasm, mutations can be induced to express the
    desirable characters in the varieties.</li></p>
    <p><li>3. Conventional breeding is also known as classical or traditional breeding.
      It is the development of new varieties using traditional methods. The old
      breeding methods are still used today to improve the varieties because
      these methods are not constrained by the availability of a limited number of
    genes.</li></p>
    <p><li>4. Somaclonal variants and genetically engineered organisms are
      distinguished and selected by various breeding methods. Somaclonal
      variants are raised by in vitro culture whereas genetically engineered
    organisms are produced by manipulating the DNA.</li></p>
    <p><li>Hence, all the statements given in the question are correct.
    </li></p>
    <p><b>So, the correct answer is '4'.
