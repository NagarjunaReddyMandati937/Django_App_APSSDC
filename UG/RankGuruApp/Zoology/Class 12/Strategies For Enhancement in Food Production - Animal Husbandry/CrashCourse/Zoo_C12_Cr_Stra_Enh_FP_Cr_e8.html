    <p><li>A. Out-crossing is the mating between unrelated members of the same
      breed which have no common ancestors up to 4-6 generations. This
      breeding method is best for animals having poor milk productivity, growth
    rate and those having inbreeding depression.</li></p>
    <p><li>B. Fishery is generally an entity which is engaged in the raising or
      harvesting of fishes. It includes rearing, catching and selling of fishes as
    well as molluscs and crustaceans.</li></p>
    <p><li>C. MOET (Multiple Ovulation Embryo Transfer)is a programme for herd
      improvement in animals such as sheep, cattle etc. by increasing their
      reproduction rate. The female parent is induced for superovulation by
      injecting with follicle-stimulating hormone or FSH. The multiple eggs
      produced by ovaries are collected and artificially inseminated. The fertilised
    eggs are then transferred to surrogate mothers.</li></p>
    <p><li>
      D. Beekeeping or harvesting requires a lot of time and efforts and hence, it is
    labour intensive.</li></p>
    <p><li>Hence, all the statements given in the question are correct.
    </li></p>
    <p><b>So, the correct answer is 'Four'.
