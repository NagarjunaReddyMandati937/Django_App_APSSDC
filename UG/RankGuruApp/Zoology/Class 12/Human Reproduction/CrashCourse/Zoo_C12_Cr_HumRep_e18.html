   <ul>

     
    <p><li> During the development of foetus, many oogonia are produced which
    undergo mitosis and form primary oocytes.</li></p>
    <p><li> These primary oocytes remain
    arrested at prophase I of meiosis I throughout the childhood.</li></p>
    <p><li>It is estimated
      that about 2 million primary oocytes are present in a female at the time of
    birth.</li></p>
    <p><li>No primary oocyte is added after birth.</li></p>
    <p><li>Hence, oogonia are constant in number as they are formed at the embryonic
    stages of the foetus and no oogonia are formed after birth.</li></p>
    <p><b>So, the correct answer is 'Constant in number and never be added after
    birth'.</b></p>
