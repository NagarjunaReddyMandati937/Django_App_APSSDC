   <ul>
    
     <p><li>A primary oocyte is produced by the ovary from the oogonia during
     oogenesis.</li></p>
     <p><li>Secondary oocyte is an oocyte which is produced by the first
     meiotic division of primary oocyte.</li></p>
     <p><li>It leaves the ruptured follicle and enters
     the fallopian tube.</li></p>
     <p><li> Here, it is then pushed by cilia towards the uterus.</li></p>
     <p><li> An egg
     can live in the fallopian tube for about 24 hours.</li></p>
     <p><li>The sperm can travel up
     through the uterus to the fallopian tube and can fertilize with the egg.</li></p>
     <p><li>  The
     fertilized egg stays in the fallopian tube for about 3 to 4 days.</li></p>
     <p><li>However, the
     fertilized egg starts dividing after 24 hours.</li></p>
     <p><li> A fertilized egg is called a zygote
     until it divides into 16 cells and forms a morula.</li></p>
     <p><li>Hence, out of the given
       structures, secondary oocyte, egg, and zygote may be found in fallopian
     tubes.</li></p>

     <p><b>     Thus, the correct answer is 'Three'.
