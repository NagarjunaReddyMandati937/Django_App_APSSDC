   <ul>
 
     <p><li>Sperms are produced from the male germ cells and this process is known
      as spermatogenesis. 
      <ul>
        <p><li>Spermatogenesis consists of two stages, formation of
        spermatids and spermiogenesis.</li></p>
        <p><li>The male germ cells divide mitotically and
        form spermatogonia.</li></p>

      </ul>
    </li></p>
    <p><li>The spermatogonial cells accumulate chromatin material and become
      primary spermatocytes.
      <ul>
        <p><li> Primary spermatocytes undergo meiosis I and form
         secondary spermatocytes which further undergo meiosis II to form
       spermatids.</li></p>
       <p><li>Each spermatid develops into a sperm and this process is
       called spermiogenesis or spermiation.</li></p>
       <p><li>      Hence, the assertion is correct.
       </li></p>
       <p><li>The spermatids derive their nutrition from sertoli cells which are the
       somatic cells of the testis.</li></p>
       <p><li>Hence, the reason is also true but it is not the
       correct explanation for the assertion.</li></p>

     </ul>
   </li></p>

   <p><b>So, the correct answer is 'Both Assertion and Reason are correct but Reason
   is not the correct explanation for Assertion'.</b></p>
