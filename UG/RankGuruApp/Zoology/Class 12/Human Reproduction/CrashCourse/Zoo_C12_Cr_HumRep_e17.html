   <ul>
    
    <p><li>The hypothalamus secretes the Gonadotropin-releasing hormone which is
    responsible for menstruation sequence.</li></p>
    <p><li>The GnrRH repressed by the
    prolactin hormone, which encourages the production of milk.</li></p>
    <p><li>Without the
    GnRH release, the menstrual cycle wont begin a new event of pregnancy.</li></p>
    <p><li>As long as prolactin level are high, GnRH generally won't be release.</li></p>
    <p><li>Now
    GnRH is responsible for the release of the follicular stimulating hormone.</li></p>
    <p><li>The hormone FSH is responsible for the formation of ovarian follicle.</li></p>
    <p><li>So, as
      GnRH is stopped there will be an inhibition in the release of FSH by prolactin
    and thus thus it counter the effects of FSH on the ovarian follicle.</li></p>
    <p><li>So, there
    will be a delay in ovulation that will automatically prevent pregnancy.</li></p>

    <p><b>So, the correct option is 'Inhibiting the release of FSH by prolactin and thus
    countering the effects of FSH on the ovarian follicle'.</b></p>
