   <ul>
     
    <p><li>Lactational amenorrhea is the temporary postnatal (immediate after
      childbirth) infertility that occurs when a woman is amenorrheic (not
    menstruating) and fully breastfeeding.</li></p>
    <p><li> Breastfeeding can suppress
    ovulation and thus serve as a form of birth control.</li></p>
    <p><li> During the breastfeed
      the same hormones that make milk, called prolactin, also suppress the
    release of hormones that cause eggs to mature and become fertile.</li></p>
    <p><li>There is
      no menstruation during lactation amenorrhea because there is no ovulation
    due to increase in levels of prolactin.</li></p>
    
    <p><b>So, the correct answer is 'Both A and C'.</b></p>
