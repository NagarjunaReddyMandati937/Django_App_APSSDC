    <p><li> Implantation is one of the stage of pregnancy.</li></p>
    <p><li> During this stage, the
    blastocyst attaches to the wall of the uterus on uterine endometrium.</li></p>
    <p><li>The
      developing embryo receives oxygen and nutrients from the mother from this
    attachement.</li></p>
    <p><li> Implantation is controlled by trophoblast and occurs by
    decidual cell reaction.</li></p>
    <p><li> The decidual cell reaction is serious of reactions that
      takes place in the endometrium of the uterus in order to prepare it for
    implantation of an embryo.</li></p>
    <p><li> This reaction is seen in each menstrual cycle
    and enhanced after implantation.</li></p>
