   <ul>
    
    <p><li>Ovulation is the release of a mature egg from the female ovary that enables
    the egg to be fertilized by the male sperm cells.</li></p>
    <p><li> Primary oocytes are formed
      prenatally and remain suspended in prophase I of meiosis I for years until
    the onset of puberty.</li></p>
    <p><li>During ovulation, primary oocyte completes meiosis I
    as its follicle matures.</li></p>
    <p><li>One of the division product is eliminated as the polar
      body, and the other, secondary oocyte stays in metaphase II throughout
    ovulation until fertilization.</li></p>
    <p><b>So the correct option is 'Secondary oocyte at Metaphase II of Meiosis II'.    
    </b></p>
