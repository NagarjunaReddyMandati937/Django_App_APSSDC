   <ul>
    <p><li>Sponges and Cnidarians are among the animals, that can reproduce by
    budding.</li></p>
    <p><li>A small part of the parent's body separates from the rest and
    develops into a new individual.</li></p>
    <p><li>Sometimes the buds remain attached and
    become more or less independent members of a colony.</li></p>
    <p><li>In some tunicate
      colonies, different individuals are connected by root-like structures
    called stolons.</li></p>
    <p><li>In others, they share body parts, such as their
    atrial (exhaling) siphon.</li></p>
    <p><li>These tunicates reproduce asexually through
    budding example Botryllus schlosseri.</li></p>
    <p><li>The scyphistoma reproduces
      asexually, producing similar polyps by budding, and then either
      transforming into a medusa or budding several medusae off from its upper
    surface.</li></p>
    <p><li>The medusae are initially microscopic and may take years to reach
    sexual maturity.</li></p>


    <p><b>So, the correct answer is option D.  
    </b></p>
