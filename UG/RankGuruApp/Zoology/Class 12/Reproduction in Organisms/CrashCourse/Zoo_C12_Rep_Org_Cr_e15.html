    <p><li> There are two ways in which reproduction can takes place, that is sexual
      reproduction and asexual reproduction. In sexual reproduction, both
    parents are involved.</li></p>
    <p><li>In asexual reproduction, the progeny is produced from the single parent.
      <ul>
        <p><li>
          Various methods of asexual reproduction include budding, fragmentation,
        binary fission, sporulation, and regeneration.</li></p>
        <p><li>Archaeocytes are amoeboid cells found in sponges that are totipotent in
        nature.</li></p>
        <p><li>Gemmulation is the method of reproduction seen in sponges using
        gemmules.</li></p>

      </ul></li></p>
      <p><li>Out of these methods, the most common methods of asexual reproduction
      are by binary fission and budding.</li></p>

      <p><b>Thus, the correct answer is 'Budding'.   
      </b></p>
