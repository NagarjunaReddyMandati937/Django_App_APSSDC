   <ul>
     

     
    <p><li> In monecious plants, both male and female flowers are present on the same
      plant whereas in dioecious plants, male and female flowers are present on
      different flowers.
      <ul>
        <p><li> Hence, assertion is correct.
        </li></p>
      </ul>
    </li></p>
    <p><li>In bisexual flowers, both male and female reproductive structures i.e.
      androecium and gynoecium respectively, are present whereas in unisexual
      flowers, either male or female reproductive structures are present.
      <ul>
        <p><li>Hence,
        reason is also true but it is not the correct explanation for assertion.</li></p>

      </li></p>
      
      
    </ul>

    <p><b>So, the correct answer is 'Both Assertion and Reason are correct but Reason
    is not the correct explanation for Assertion'.</b></p>
