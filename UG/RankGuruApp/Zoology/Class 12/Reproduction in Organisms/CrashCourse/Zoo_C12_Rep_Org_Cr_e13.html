   <ul>
  
    <p><li>Asexual reproduction is a method of reproduction in which offspring
    develops from a single parent.</li></p>
    <p><li>It does not involve fusion of gametes.</li></p>
    <p><li> There
      are various methods of asexual reproduction such as budding, spore
      formation, binary fission, division, fragmentation, vegetative propagation,
    sporogenesis.</li></p>
    <p><li>  In fission, the content of cell are replicated internally and
    then are subjected to division to form two equal daughter cells.</li></p>
    <p><li>In budding,
    a bud is formed at a certain point on parent.</li></p>
    <p><li>It grows fully and then
    eventually break away from the parent organism.</li></p>
    <p><li> In vegetative propagation,
    the new plant is formed from vegetative part such as tuber, bulb, sucker.</li></p>
    <p><li> In
    sporogenesis, the new individual is formed from a spore.</li></p>
    <p><li>In fragmentation, a
    new organism grows from a fragment of the parent.</li></p>

    <p><b>Thus, the correct answer is 'All of the above'.
