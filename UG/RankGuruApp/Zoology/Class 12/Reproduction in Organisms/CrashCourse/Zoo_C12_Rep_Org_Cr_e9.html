   <ul>
     
     
    <p><li>Budding is a type of asexual reproduction in which a new organism
      develops from an outgrowth or bud due to cell division at one particular site.
      <ul>
        <p><li>The process of budding can be seen in hydra and yeast. Budding in hydra
          involves a small bud which is developed from its parent hydra through the
        repeated mitotic division of its cells.</li></p>
        <p><li>The small bud then receives its
        nutrition from the parent hydra and grows healthy.</li></p>
        <p><li>Growth starts by
        developing small tentacles and the mouth.</li></p>
        <p><li>Finally, the small newly
          produced hydra gets separate from its parent hydra and becomes an
        independent organism.</li></p>
        <p><li>In yeast, a small bud arises as an outgrowth of the
        parent body.</li></p>
        <p><li> Later the nucleus of the parent yeast is separated into two
        parts and one of the nuclei shifts into the bud.</li></p>
        <p><li>The newly created bud
        divides and grows into a new cell.</li></p>


      </ul>
    </li></p>
    
    <p><b>So, the correct answer is 'Yeast and Hydra'.</b></p>

  </ul>
