    <p><li>In women, both sex chromosomes are the same and are therefore called as
    XX. In males, they are different and called as XY.</li></p>
    <p><li>When sperm and eggs (ova)
    are made during meiosis they separate to form different gametes.</li></p>
    <p><li> As
    women have XX, their eggs always carry the X chromosomes.</li></p>
    <p><li> As males have
      XY, approximately half their sperm carry the X chromosome while the
    remainder carries the Y chromosome.</li></p>
