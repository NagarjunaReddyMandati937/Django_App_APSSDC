    <li><p style="display: inline">Biomolecules with molecular weights more than one thousand Dalton are
    called biomacromolecules. </p></li>
    <li><p style="display: inline">These are found in the acid-insoluble fraction.
      Lipids are not strictly macromolecules as their molecular weights do not
    exceed 800 Da but form a part of the acid insoluble pool.</p></li>
    <li><p style="display: inline"> The molecules in
      the insoluble fraction with the exception of lipids are polymeric substances.
      Lipids are indeed small molecular weight compounds and are present not
      only as such but also arranged into structures like cell membrane and other
    membranes. </p></li>
    <li><p style="display: inline">So the acid insoluble fraction has only four types of organic
      compounds, proteins, polysaccharides nucleic acids and lipids but except
    for lipids none of them are micromolecules.</p></li>
    <li><p style="display: inline"><b>So the correct option is 'The compounds which are found in the acid
      insoluble fraction are called micromolecules'.
    </b></p></li>
