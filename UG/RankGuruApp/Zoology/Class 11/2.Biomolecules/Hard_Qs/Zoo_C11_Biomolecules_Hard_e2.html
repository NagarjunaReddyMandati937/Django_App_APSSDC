    <li><p style="display: inline">Starch is the stored form of sugar in plants, a homopolymer of glucose units
    exist in two forms: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p style="display: inline">amylose which is the helical form of a structure
        composed of &#945;1-4 glycosidic linkages, and amylopectin has a structure like
        glycogen except that &#945; 1- 6 glycosidic linkage present only at branches and
        amylose in starch is responsible for the formation of deep blue colour in the
        presence of iodine as it fits into the helix structure whereas
        Glycogen is the storage form of sugar in humans and other vertebrates and
      more highly branched structure than amylopectin but lacks &#945; 1-6 bonding.</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p style="display: inline">Glycogen is usually stored in liver and muscle cells whereas starch stored in
  the amyloplast cells in plants.</p></li>
