    <li><p style="display: inline">A. A covalent bond is formed by sharing of electrons between the atoms.
    </p></li>
    <li><p style="display: inline">B. A glycosidic bond is a kind of covalent linkage by which two
      monosaccharides are joined together. Whenever a glycosidic bond is
      formed, there is the elimination of a water molecule similar to the formation
      of a peptide bond. These reactions are called dehydration or condensation
    reactions.</p></li>
    <li><p style="display: inline">C. A peptide bond is formed between the carboxyl group of one amino acid
    and the amino group of another amino acid.</p></li>
    <li><p style="display: inline">
      D. An ionic bond is formed due to electrostatic attraction between oppositely
    charged ions.</p></li>
    <li><p style="display: inline">So, the correct answer is 'Glycosidic bond'.
    </p></li>
