	<p><b>Canary Current:</b></p>
	<p><li>	It is part of a clockwise-setting ocean-current system in the North Atlantic Ocean. </li></p>
	<p><li>It branches south from the North Atlantic Current and flows southwestward along the northwest coast of Africa as far south as Senegal before 
	turning westward to eventually join the Atlantic North Equatorial Current. </li></p>
	<p><li>The cool temperature of the current is produced by upwelling caused by offshore winds from the continent. </li></p>
	<p><li>As the current flows around the Canary Islands, it helps to lessen the heating effect of the Sahara to the east. </li></p>
	<p><li>The thermal mixing creates excellent fishing grounds in the region.</li></p>
<p><B>Gulf Stream:</B></P>
<p><li>The <b>Gulf Stream</b> is a warm and swift Atlantic ocean current that brings warm water from the Gulf of Mexico into the Atlantic Ocean. </li></p>
<p><li>It originates in the Gulf of Mexico and stretches to the tip of Florida and follows the eastern coastlines of the United States and New foundland 
before crossing the Atlantic Ocean.</li></p>
<p><b>Falkland Current:</b></p>
	<p><li>Falkland Current branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current in the Southern Hemisphere, flowing northward in the South Atlantic Ocean along the 
east coast of Argentina to about latitude 30° to 40°S, where it is deflected eastward after meeting the southward-flowing Brazil Current. </li></p>
<p><li>It is characterized by cold temperatures. </li></p>
<p><li>Icebergs originating in the Weddell Sea are carried by the Falkland Current approximately as far north as latitude 35°S.
