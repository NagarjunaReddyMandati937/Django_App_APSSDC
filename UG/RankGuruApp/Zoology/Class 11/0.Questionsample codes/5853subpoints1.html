		<p><li>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods
		 and services, such as transportation, food, and medical care. <b>Hence, statement 1 is correct.</b></li></p>
		<p><li>Because of the wide disparities in the consumption baskets for different segment of consumers, India has adopted the following CPIs.</p>


	<ul><p><li>CPI - Rural, CPI - Urban , CPI - All India - computed by Central Statistics Office under the Ministry of Statistics 
	and Programme Implementation.</li></p>
	<p><li>CPI (Industrial Workers), CPI (Agricultural Labour), CPI (Rural Labour) - computed by Labour Bureau of Labour Ministry.
	<b> Hence statement 2 is not correct.</b></li></p></ul></li>


		<p><li>For Individual CPI for Urban and Rural areas, weights of different goods are assigned differently. For example,
		 CPI rural has zero weight to housing & 54.18 weight to food and beverages.</li></p>
		<p><li>In India, RBI uses CPI (combined) released by  CSO  for  inflation  purpose  with  base  year  as 2012.</li></p>
		 <p><li>The number of items in CPI basket includes 448 in rural and 460 in urban.<b> Hence statement 3 is correct.</b></li></p>
