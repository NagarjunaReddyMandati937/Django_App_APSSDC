    <li><p style="display: inline">Epithelial cells form the diffusion boundary at many places including as in
      nephron and alveoli and are actively involved in absorption and secretion.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p style="display: inline">Hence, they are closely associated with movement of molecules across it,
        which help to keep it moist and prevent any normal wear and tear due to
      chemical or mechanical stress.</p></li>

  <li><p style="display: inline"><b>
    So, the correct option is 'Epithelial cell are kept moist due to the material
  that diffuse through it'.</b></p></li>
