     <p><b>The monocot stem shows the following characteristics :</b></p> 
     <p><li>I. Vascular bundles are scattered in the ground tissue, conjoint, collateral
      and they are surrounded by the sclerenchymatous layer of bundle sheath.
      They have a lysigenous cavity formed by the breakdown of inner protoxylem
    vessels and parenchyma.</li></p>
    <p><li>II. The hypodermis is made up of sclerenchymatous cells.
    </li></p>
    <p><li>III. The peripheral vascular bundles are smaller in size and are more than the
    central vascular bundles.</li></p>
    <p><li>IV. Ground tissue is not differentiated into cortex, pericycle, pith etc.
    </li></p>
    <p><li>V. Ground tissue is homogeneous and is made of parenchymatous cells.
    </li></p>
    <p><b>Hence, The correct answer is 'Ground tissue is differentiated into cortex,
    pericycle, pith etc'.</b></p>
