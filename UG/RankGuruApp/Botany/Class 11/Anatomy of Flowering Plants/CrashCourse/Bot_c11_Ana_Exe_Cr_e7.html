   <ul>
     
    <p><li>Companion cells are specialized parenchyma cell, located in the phloem of
      flowering plants and closely associated with the development and function
    of a sieve-tube element.</li></p>
    <p><li> Its nucleus regulates the activity of the adjacent
      sieve element and to take part in loading and unloading sugar into the sieve
    element by maintaining pressure in sieve tube.</li></p>
    <p><li>Companion cells are present
    only in flowering plants but not in all vascular plants.</li></p>
    
    <p><b>So, The correct answer is 'It is present in all vascular plants having phloem'.    
    </b></p>
