   <ul>

    <p><li>On the basis of location and function, three main tissue systems are found in
    plants, dermal, vascular, and ground tissue.</li></p>
    <p><li> Dermal tissue is composed of
      epidermal cells, closely packed cells that secrete a waxy cuticle that aids in the
    prevention of water loss.</li></p>
    <p><li>The primary components of vascular tissue are the
    xylem and phloem.</li></p>
    <p><li>The ground tissue of plants includes all tissues that are
    neither dermal nor vascular.</li></p>
    <p><li>The three types of ground tissue, parenchyma,
      collenchyma, and sclerenchyma, function in photosynthesis, storage,
    regeneration, support, and protection.</li></p>
    <p><b>So, the correct answer is '3'.</b></p>
