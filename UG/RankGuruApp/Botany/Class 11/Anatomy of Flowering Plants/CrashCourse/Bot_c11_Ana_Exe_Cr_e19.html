   <ul>
    
     <p><li>Stomata are pores found on the surface of leaves.</li></p>
     <p><li>  These pores help in
     exchange of gases from the environment and also in transpiration.</li></p>
     <p><li>Lenticels are pores found on bark of woody plants which allow gaseous
     exchange between atmosphere and internal tissues.</li></p>
     <p><li>At night stomata are closed and soil moisture content is high.</li></p>
     <p><li>This leads to
     high root pressure which leads to water accumulation in plants.</li></p>
     <p><li>This excess
      sap leaks from the tip of leaves and this process of exudation of xylem sap
    is known as guttation.</li></p>
    <p><li> Guttation pores are not aerating and do not allow
    gaseous exchange, they are only involved in getting rid of excess water.</li></p>
    <p><b>Thus the correct answer is B.   
    </b></p>
