   <ul>
     
    <p><li> Springwood is formed due to the rapid activity of the vascular cambium.</li></p>
    <p><li>The
    vessels are wider in lumen.</li></p>
    <p><li>It is light and has low density.</li></p>
    <p><li>Heartwood is the
    wood that has non-functional vessels due to deposition of lignin by tyloses.</li></p>
    <p><li>It appears dark and has more density.</li></p>
    <p><b> So, the correct answer is springwood
    is lighter in colour and has a lower density as compared to heartwood.</b></p>
