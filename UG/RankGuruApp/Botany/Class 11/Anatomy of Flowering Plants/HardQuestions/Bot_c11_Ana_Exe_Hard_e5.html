   <ul>
    
     <p><li>Stelar region of the plants is made up of the conducting tissues.</li></p>
     <p><li>The
      secondary meristem gives rise to an extensive secondary xylem in the stelar
    region and the secondary phloem towards outside.</li></p>
    <p><li>The secondary xylem so
    formed is called wood.</li></p>
    <p><li> The wood which is formed in the early phases
      becomes non-functional after a period of time due to the deposition of
    tyloses.</li></p>
    <p><li>Such a wood is called heart-wood or duramen.</li></p>
    <p><li>It is non-conducting
    wood, The wood is formed later is called the sap-wood or the alburnum.</li></p>
    <p><li> It is
    the functional wood.</li></p>
    <p><b>Hence, the correct answer is 'Duramen and Alburnum'
    </b></p>
