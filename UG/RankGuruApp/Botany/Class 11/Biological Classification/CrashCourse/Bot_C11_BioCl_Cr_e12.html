    <p><li>A) The viruses are non-cellular organisms that are characterized by having
      an inert crystalline structure outside the living cell. Once they infect a cell
      they take over the machinery of the host cell to replicate themselves and kill
    the host.</li></p>
    <p><li>B) A virus does not contain both RNA and DNA either they contain DNA as
    genetic material or RNA as genetic material.</li></p>
    <p><li>C) AIDS is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is an infection caused by
    the virus name HIV(human immunodeficiency virus).</li></p>
    <p><li>HIV is a retrovirus
      which use to attack on macrophages and T cells and uses their machinery
    to replicate which leads to destroying the host cells.</li></p>
    <p><li>D) Generally, the viruses that infect plants have single-stranded RNA.</li></p>
    <p><b>So the correct answer is 'Virus contains both RNA and DNA.'.
