   <ul>

    <p><li>A. Viruses are non cellular organisms as they don't have any cellular
    structure and their genetic material is enclosed within a protein capsule.</li></p>
    <p><li>B. Viruses can be crystallized by which their viral components are organized
    into solid particles.</li></p>
    <p><li>C. Viruses contain either DNA or RNA as their genetic material but not both.</li></p>
    <p><li>D. Viruses attack plants and show some common symptoms of their
      infection like mosaic formation (a characteristic pattern formation),
    yellowing of leaves, clearing of veins etc.</li></p>
    <p><li>Hence, statement C is incorrect.
    </li></p>
    <p><b>So, the correct answer is 'Virus contain both DNA and RNA'.    
    </b></p>
