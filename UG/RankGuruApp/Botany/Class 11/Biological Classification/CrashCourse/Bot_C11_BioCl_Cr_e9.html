    <p><li>Ascomycota is a division or phylum of the kingdom Fungi.
      <ul>
        <p><li>Its members are
        commonly known as the sac fungi or ascomycetes.</li></p>
        <p><li>The defining feature of
          this fungal group is the "ascus", a microscopic sexual structure in which
        nonmotile spores, called ascospores, are formed.</li></p>
        <p><li> They are asexual, meaning
          that they do not have a sexual cycle and thus do not form asci or
        ascospores.</li></p>
      </ul>
    </li></p>
    <p><li>Whereas, An ascospore is a spore contained in an ascus or that was
    produced inside an ascus.</li></p>
    <p><b>So, the correct answer is ' Assertion is incorrect and the reason is correct'.  
    </b></p>
