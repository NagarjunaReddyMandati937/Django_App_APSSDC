   <ul>
     
    <p><li>The plasmodium is a sporozoan protist which passes its life cycle in two
      hosts, Anopheles female mosquito as a primary host and human as a
    secondary host.</li></p>
    <p><li>Its life cycle is complex as it involves two distinct sexual
    and asexual phase.</li></p>
    <p><li>The spores containing true walls are extremely resistant
    as it can survive for many years under unfavourable conditions.</li></p>

    <p><b>So, the correct option is 'The spores possess true walls but can survive only
    for a few months'.</b></p>
