   <ul>
     
    <p><li> Virus, is a nucleoprotein entity which is able to utilize the synthetic
      machinery of a living cell of another organism for its multiplication which
    does not involve the growth and the division.</li></p>
    <p><li>Pasteur coined the term virus
    before its scientific discovery.</li></p>
    <p><li>The virus cannot grow on non living culture
    medium.</li></p>
    <p><li> It requires living cells for its metabolism and multiplication.</li></p>
    <p><li>The virus is an obligate parasite as it is inert outside the host cell.</li></p>
    <p><li>An inert
    virus is called the Virion.</li></p>
    <p><li>A Biosynthetic machinery is absent.</li></p>
    <p><li> There is no
    system to liberate energy.</li></p>
    <p><li> A virus does not grow.</li></p>
    <p><li>It does not divide or
    reproduce like typical organisms without host machinery.</li></p>
    <p><li> It multiplies by independent formation of its parts using host machinery
    and then assembly of parts to produce virus particles.</li></p>
    <p><li>A virus lacks
    irritability and motility.</li></p>
    <p><li>  It requires a vector for transfer from one host to
    another.</li></p>
    <p><b>So the correct option is 'All of the above'.
    </b></p>
