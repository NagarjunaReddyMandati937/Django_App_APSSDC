   <ul>

     
    <p><li>A- Desmids are single-celled green algae which can only be found in fresh
    water. They can be represented by their symmetry.</li></p>
    <p><li>B- Dino-flagellates are the most common sources of bio-luminescence at
      the surface of the ocean. They are neither plant nor animal, rather they are
    unicellular protists.</li></p>
    <p><li>C- Euglenoids are single celled organism that are mostly autotrophic but
      they can be heterotrophic. They are both free-living and parasitic. They share
    the characteristics of both plants and animals.</li></p>
    <p><li>D- Slime moulds are one of the species of primitive organisms containing
    true nuclei and resembling both protozoan protists and fungi.</li></p>

    <p><b>So, the correct option is ' Euglenoids'.</b></p>
