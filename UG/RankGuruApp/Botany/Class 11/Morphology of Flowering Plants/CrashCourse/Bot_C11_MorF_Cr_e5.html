   <ul>
    

    <p><li>The root of some plants growing in saline marshes (mangrove plants)
    suffers from a lack of oxygen.</li></p>
    <p><li> This is due to the waterlogged condition of the
    soil. </li></p>
    <p><li>To cope with the situation some root branches grow vertically upward
      and become negatively geotropic and bear many minute pores called
    nematodes toward their upper end and help in gaseous exchange.</li></p>
    
    <p><b>So the correct option is 'Both Assertion and Reason are correct and Reason
    is the correct explanation of Assertion'.</b></p>
