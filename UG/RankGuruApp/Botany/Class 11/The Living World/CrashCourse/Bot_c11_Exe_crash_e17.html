      and simple vegetative as well as floral or reproductive characters are
    considered for grouping.</li></p>
    <p><li>Herbariums have a collection of preserved plant specimens and information
    about them.</li></p>
    <p><li>They are quick and easy referrals for taxonomical studies.</li></p>
