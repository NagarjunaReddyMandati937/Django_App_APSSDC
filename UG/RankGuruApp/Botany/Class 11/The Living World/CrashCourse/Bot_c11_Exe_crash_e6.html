    <p><li>In taxonomic hierarchy as we go from kingdom to species, complexity of
    classification increases. </li></p>
    <p><li>Higher the category, higher will be the difficulty in
    determining the relationship of different taxa at same level.</li></p>
    <p><li>Hence,
    assertion is correct.</li></p>
    <p><li>As we go from kingdom to species, common characters between different
    taxa increase. </li></p>
    <p><li>Lower the taxa, more will the common characters between the
    members of the taxa.</li></p>
    <p><li>Hence, reason is also true but it is not the correct
    explanation for assertion.</li></p>
    <p><b>So, the correct answer is 'Both Assertion and Reason are correct but Reason
    is not the correct explanation for Assertion'</b></p>
