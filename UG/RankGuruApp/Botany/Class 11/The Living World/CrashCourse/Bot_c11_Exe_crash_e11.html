   <ul>
    
    <p><li>A phylogeny (or a tree of life) is a theory about how organisms are related to
    one another through evolutionary time.</li></p>
    <p><li>Phylogenies are based on the assumption that more closely related species
      will be more similar to one another, and they are commonly built using
    genetic sequences or physical characters.</li></p>
    <p><li>Hence, Phylogeny is the developmental history of a species which is the
    basic unit of taxonomy.</li></p>
    <p><b>So, the correct answer is 'Both Assertion and Reason are correct and Reason
    is the correct explanation for Assertion'.</b></p>
