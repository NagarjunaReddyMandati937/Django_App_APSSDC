    <p><li>Aggregates of characters are used to define and separate different higher
    taxonomic categories.</li></p>
    <p><li>As we go higher from species to kingdom the number of common
    characteristics goes on decreasing.</li></p>
    <p><li>That means that two organisms belonging to same species will share far
      more common characteristics than those organism belonging to the same
    kingdom.</li></p>
    <p><li>Here, these two statements given in assertion and reason are independently
    correct.</li></p>
    <p><b>So, the correct option is 'Both Assertion and Reason are correct but Reason
    is not the correct explanation for Assertion'.</b></p>
