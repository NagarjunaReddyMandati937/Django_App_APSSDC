    <p><li>The holotype is a specimen or illustration which is designated as the
      representative of a species and is used for identification of the new
    specimen.</li></p>
    <p><li>A lectotype is a specimen or any other material which is selected from
      original material as cited by the author when holotype is not available.
      <ul>
        <p><li>A syntype is any of two or more specimens that were simultaneously
        designated as a type when no holotype was designated.</li></p>
      </ul>
    </li></p>
    <p><li>A specimen or any other material which serve as type specimen in absence
      of holotype, isotype, paratype or syntype is referred to as neotype
      .
      <ul>
        <p><li>A type specimen is an element to which name of a taxon is associated
        irrespective of being it the original name or synonym.</li></p>
        <p><li>A type specimen can
          serve as holotype/syntype/neotype/isotope, depending on the way of its
        selection.</li></p>
      </ul>
