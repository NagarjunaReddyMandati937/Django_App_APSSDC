    <p><li>During mitosis, a eukaryotic cell undergoes a carefully coordinated nuclear
      division that results in the formation of two genetically identical daughter
    cells.</li></p>
    <p><li>Before the cells can enter the active phases of mitosis, however, it must go
      through a period known as interphase, during which it grows and produces
    the various proteins necessary for the division.</li></p>
    <p><li>
      Prophase is the first phase of mitosis. During the phase, the chromosomes
    inside the cell's nucleus condense and form tight structures.</li></p>
    
    <p><b>So the correct option is 'A -Interphase B- Prophase'.
