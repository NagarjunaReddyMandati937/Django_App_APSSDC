      <p> 
        During the G<sub>2</sub> phase, the organelles are duplicated and the proteins required
      for the division are synthesized.</p>


      <p><li>A. During <b>M-</b>phase the karyokinesis and cytokinesis occur. During the
        karyokinesis, the division of chromosomes occurs. After that, the cytoplasm
      is divided in cytokinesis.</li></p>
      <p><li>B. During <b>G<sub>1</sub></b> phase the machinery of proteins required for DNA replication
      occurs.</li></p>
      <p><li>C. No division activity occurs during the <b>G<sub>0</sub></b> phase, It is called the quiescent
      phase or resting phase.</li></p>
      <p><li>D. During the <b>G<sub>2</sub></b> phase, organelles are duplicated and the cell commits for
      the division.</li></p>
      
      <p><b>Hence, the correct answer is 'G<sub>2</sub> phase'.
