    <p><li>A- Gap 1 phase is the time during which the cell makes more proteins so
    that it can grow to its proper size.</li></p>
    <p><li>
      B- Synthesis phase is the time during which the cell copies its DNA in
    preparation for mitosis.</li></p>
    <p><li>C- Gap 2 phase is the time during which a cell replicates its organelles in
    preparation for meiosis.</li></p>
    <p><li>D- G0 This phase is known as the quiescent stage of interphase, where the
    cells exit the cell cycle and enter this phase in order to differentiate.</li></p>
    <p><b>So the correct option is 'Quiescent phase or G0 phase'.
