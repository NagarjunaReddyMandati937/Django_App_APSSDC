			<p><li>All cells usually have a fixed life span. The cells divide for a certain period of
			time, after which they die. </li></p>
			<p><li>This has been explained by the phrase
			"programmed cell death". </li></p>
			<p><li>The lifespan of each type of the body cells differ
				and it depends on the function it is destined to perform. Neurons are long
			lived and are generally non-mitotic. </li></p>
			<p><li>Memory T cells and memory B cells can
				provide long lasting immunity from exposure to antigens, they too are long
			lasting but their life span is less than that of a neuron.</li></p>
			<p><li>The lifespan of RBC is shortest amongst the options which are given, it is 115
			days.</li></p>
			<p><b> Thus, the correct answer is option D.</b></p>
