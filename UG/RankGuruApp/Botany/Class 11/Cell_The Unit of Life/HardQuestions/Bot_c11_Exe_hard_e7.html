      <p><li>Cell theory was proposed by a German botanist, Matthias Schleiden and
      English zoologist, Theodor Schwann in the year 1839. </li></p>
      <p><li>Cell theory was
        considered as the most acceptable theory which, elucidated the functioning
      of a cell.</li></p>



    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p><b>The cell theory includes the following points -
      </b></p>
      <p><li> All living things are made up of cells</li></p>
      <p><li>The cell is the smallest living thing that can perform all the functions of
      life.</li></p>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <p><li>Later on, in the year 1855 Rudolf Virchow added a new point in cell theory
        that all cells must come from pre-existing cells, which was also known as
        "Omnis cellula e cellula".<li>
        </p>
